# Orbit Navigator

## Introduction

Orbit Navigator started as, team project for CANSAT, where I had to develop a Ground Control Station (GCS), and Flight Software (FSW) for the CANSAT.

### Ground Control Station

To start with the development of a GCS, I needed to make a GUI application that can connect to the satellite via serial communication. So I did some research on different ways to create a GUI application, and you can find the explanation of each method in next sections.

### Flight Software

For FSW, I needed to write code for a micro controller, I had to choose between many choices. I have explained the considerations and final decisions in the following sections.
